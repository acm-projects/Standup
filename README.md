# Standup
Attend a virtual comedy club where you choose to perform stand-up on-stage or to engage and control the show as the audience .

### Features
- Video broadcast lobbies that users can create or view as an audience
- Upvote/Downvote performances to provide feedback
- "Discover page" shows all currently open lobbies

### Future Plans
- User Profile -> Ability to see stats on performance, graphs of performance over time, etc. Allow them to have a deep data dive into their performance so they can see their growth over time. Data is beautiful
- Leaderboard with score -> based on someone performance they are given a score, so there would be live rankings based on region and score which would feature the top comedians on the platform
- Enhanced discover page, similar to Instagram, based on user profile, location and preferences

### Tech Stack
